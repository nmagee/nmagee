## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I teach systems at the University of Virginia's [School of Data Science](https://datascience.virginia.edu/). This means tools, platforms and infrastructure â€” containers, Kubernetes, HPC, GPUs â€” as well as a variety of databases and managed services. My work centers on designing and building systems in support of computational research, focusing heavily on containers, CI/CD, and automation/orchestration for bioinformatic, genomic, and other research workflows.

Here are some courses I have taught or will be teaching:

- DS1002 Programming for Data Science
- DS2002 Data Science Systems
- DS2022 Systems I - Introduction to Computing (new, BSDS major)
- DS3022 Systems II - Advanced Data Systems (new, BSDS major)
- CS4740 Cloud Computing

Things that interest me lately:

- Apache Pulsar
- Apache Airflow
- `dotenvx`
