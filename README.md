## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I teach systems at the University of Virginia's [School of Data Science](https://datascience.virginia.edu/). This means tools, platforms and infrastructure â€” containers, Kubernetes, HPC, GPUs â€” as well as a variety of databases and managed services. My work centers on designing and building systems in support of computational research, focusing heavily on containers, CI/CD, and automation/orchestration for bioinformatic, genomic, and other research workflows.

Here are some courses I have taught or will be teaching:

- DS1002 Programming for Data Science
- DS2002 Data Science Systems
- DS2022 Systems I - Introduction to Computing (new, BSDS major)
- DS3022 Systems II - Advanced Data Systems (new, BSDS major)
- CS4740 Cloud Computing

Things that interest me lately:

- [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/) - asynchronous message queuing for loose coupling.
- [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) - particularly automating DAGs on events, file changes, messages, API hooks, etc.
- [Flow Architectures](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/flow-architectures/9781492075882/)
- [Service Mesh Design](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/concepts/service-mesh)
- [`dotenvx`](https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx) - encrypted secrets that are easier and more portable than `kubeseal` or Vault.
